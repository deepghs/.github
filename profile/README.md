# 🌟 Who We Are  

**DeepGHS** (*Deep Generative anime Hobbyist Syndicate*) is a passion-driven, non-profit community building anime/2D-focused infrastructure—because even otakus deserve robust tooling! 🎨  

We obsess over **ALL things anime-tech**:  
- 🖼️ Multimodal datasets (images, video, text, audio, 3D)  
- 🤖 AI models that actually *get* anime aesthetics  
- 🔧 Developer tools to make weeb R&D 10x easier  

**Our crew** includes:  
- **narugo1992** (self-proclaimed Jerry Mouse 🐭 | Software Engineering PhD | 25+ years of coding/teamwork wizardry)  
- A global squad of AI nerds + anime addicts from top labs/universities 🎓  
- Pro artists who know "moe" isn’t just a typo 🎨  

*Fun fact: We hire based on* ***passion for anime*** *first, technical skills second. (Sorry, resume bots!)*  

**Why trust us?**  
✅ 100% non-profit | ✅ Fully open-source | ✅ Zero paywalls (forever!)  
💖 Backed by sponsors & collaborators who *get* our vision
